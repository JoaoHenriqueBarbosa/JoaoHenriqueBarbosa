### About

Software engineer from Paraná, Brazil. I build products — not projects. I prefer the discipline of maintaining and evolving systems over selling consultancy hours. I work with Python, TypeScript, React, Go, and C, and lately I've been deep into AI agents, computational physics, and GPU programming.

But engineering is just one layer. What actually drives me is the raw curiosity — the kind that doesn't respect disciplinary boundaries. On any given Sunday I might be simulating quantum tunneling in OpenGL, memorizing Sanskrit verses with a memory palace, or building a cyberpunk TUI agent just to see if a while loop is all you need.

I study Advaita Vedanta seriously. I've read Nisargadatta, Ramana Maharshi, Vivekananda, the Mandukya Karika. I practice japa, observe the mind in operation, and connect phenomenological insights with neuroscience.

The question that defines me is: *why does anything exist at all, and how does it organize itself to the point of looking back and asking that question?*

I don't use social media. I make things because I like making things.

### Selected Projects

**[physics-lab](https://github.com/JoaoHenriqueBarbosa/physics-lab)** — Interactive modern physics simulations: Schrödinger equation, quantum tunneling, double slit interference, EPR entanglement, Bell test (CHSH, S = 2.87), Schwarzschild gravitational lensing with exact geodesic ray tracing. GPU-accelerated, real-time OpenGL/GLSL. `Python`

**[agent-42](https://github.com/JoaoHenriqueBarbosa/agent-42)** — Minimal autonomous coding agent. The entire agent is ~70 lines of logic — a while loop, tool use, and a Textual TUI. No frameworks, no magic. The intelligence is in the model, not in the code. `Python`

**[OpenPOS](https://github.com/JoaoHenriqueBarbosa/FinOpenPOS)** — Point of Sale and Inventory Management system. Next.js, React, Supabase. 62+ stars. `TypeScript`

**[MemBot](https://github.com/JoaoHenriqueBarbosa/MemBot)** — AI-powered journaling app that organizes and analyzes daily thoughts automatically. `TypeScript`

**[PortuScript](https://github.com/JoaoHenriqueBarbosa/PortuScript-Playground)** — A programming language that transpiles Portuguese to JavaScript. Making code accessible for Portuguese speakers. `JavaScript`

**[perceptrons](https://github.com/JoaoHenriqueBarbosa/perceptrons)** — Interactive educational system for learning neural networks through hands-on experimentation. Draw patterns, train models, discover limitations. `Python` `React`
